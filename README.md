connecting in the sense that, you will be able to know with whom your music taste matches the most based on the users profile stored in our app.

1)your all time fav song.
2)your recent fav song.
3)your three fav artists.
at the end of the session, you'll be able to view the top 5 profiles with whom your music taste matches the most.
